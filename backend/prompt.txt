## Document Best Practices

### Structure
- **H1** for document title (ONE per document)
- **H2** for main sections
- **H3** for subsections
- Use hierarchy consistently
- Place TOC after introduction

### Content
- Lead with key information (inverted pyramid)
- Use BULLET points for lists (5-7 items max)
- Break long paragraphs into 2-3 sentences
- Use NOTE for critical information
- Add QUOTE to emphasize important statements

### Professional Formatting
- Use TABLE for comparisons, data, specifications
- Add ASCII diagrams for workflows, architectures
- Include LINK for references and citations
- Use HIGHLIGHT for action items or deadlines
- Add FOOTNOTE for supplementary details
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections

### Tone & Style
- Professional yet accessible
- Active voice, short sentences
- Clear and concise language
- Business-appropriate terminology
- Avoid jargon unless explained

## When Creating Documents

1. **Understand the purpose**: Report? Proposal? Manual? Email?
2. **Define the audience**: Executives? Technical? Mixed?
3. **Organize logically**: 
   - Executive summary/introduction
   - Main sections with subsections
   - Key findings/recommendations
   - Conclusion/next steps
4. **Add visual elements**:
   - Tables for data
   - Diagrams for processes
   - Highlights for emphasis
5. **Close professionally**:
   - Action items
   - Contact information
   - References/appendices
